  # Eagle

  **Eagle is an iPhone personalization utility for compatible iOS versions.**

  It lets experienced sideloading users customize wallpapers, passcode keys,
  supported Wallet cards, Home Screen elements, Dynamic Island and Dock lighting
  from one app. Private system operations require careful compatibility checks.

## What Eagle includes

| Experience | What it does |
|---|---|
| 🎨 **Styles** | Coordinates wallpaper, passcode and Wallet-card experiences. |
| 🌌 **Wallpapers** | Browses community packs, imports compatible packages and converts short videos for Pocket Poster. |
| 💳 **Cards** | Previews, applies, backs up and restores supported Wallet card artwork. |
| 🔢 **Passcode** | Browses, imports, previews, applies and restores compatible key themes. |
| 🧩 **Icon Studio · Coming soon** | Temporarily unavailable while theme importing and custom shapes are validated. |
| 📱 **Dock** | Provides layouts supporting up to six apps where SpringBoard accepts them. |
| ✨ **Aura Studio** | Applies independently colored Dynamic Island and Dock lighting. Glow, Pulse and Island Rainbow remain available where compatible; Tint is temporarily unavailable. |

### New in Eagle 1.0.1

- Prepare is available again on iPhone 16 (`iPhone17,3`) with iOS 18.5 through the established stable route.
- Aura uses model-specific Dynamic Island and Dock geometry on iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max.
- The verified iPhone 16 Pro (`iPhone17,1`) geometry and stable application paths remain unchanged.
- Aura Studio verifies the original Lara system-Island preference after writing it.
- Home, Access and the Eagle brand mark have a more consistent visual presentation.
- Icon Studio remains **Coming soon**, and Aura Tint remains temporarily unavailable while Glow, Pulse and Island Rainbow stay available where compatible.

### Aura Studio safety model

- Dynamic Island and Dock are isolated operations: one surface is never marked
  active merely because the other succeeded.
- Rainbow is available for Dynamic Island. Dock Rainbow remains disabled because
  it has not been proven reliable on a physical device.
- Home Icon Neon is initially allowlisted for iPhone 16 Pro (`iPhone17,1`) on
  iOS 18.6.2 (`22G100`) and applies a one-time snapshot page by page.
- A failed verification keeps the safety lock closed and does not trigger an
  automatic respring.
- Aura overlays may disappear after a SpringBoard respring or device reboot and
  must then be applied again.

## Install Eagle

1. Use the large **Download Eagle.ipa** button at the top of this page.
2. Sign the unsigned IPA with your preferred personal-device sideloading method.
3. Install it and open Eagle manually from the Home Screen.
4. If you installed through Xcode, press **Stop** before preparing Eagle access.
5. Apply one feature at a time and keep the exact result message if something fails.

## Compatibility and current limits

- **Prepare support:** iOS 16.x has limited testing (16.7.2 is the verified limited route);
  iOS 17.0–18.7.1 and 26.0–26.0.1 are accepted.
- Unverified iOS 16 builds, releases outside the supported ranges above and
  current MIE devices are blocked.
- iPhone 16 (`iPhone17,3`) running iOS 18.5 follows the supported Prepare route.
- Aura Studio live changes remain limited to verified iOS 17/18 SpringBoard routes.
- If Island Aura reports **Safe Compact Halo**, it will not expand with music,
  screen recording or timers. Only **Adaptive Aura** follows those layouts.
- Screen, Battery Halo and Lock experiments are hidden while their live
  SpringBoard hosts remain unverified.
- Dock and Dynamic Island Aura include dedicated geometry for iPhone 14 Pro,
  iPhone 14 Pro Max and the primary iPhone 16 Pro reference profile. Other
  supported models may still require model-specific validation.
- Icon importing, nonstandard masks and community packages remain dependent on
  device, iOS version and package structure.
- Kernel or SpringBoard operations are intentionally blocked while the Xcode
  debugger is attached.

Device strings such as `iPhone15,2` are Apple's technical model identifiers
(`iPhone15,2` is an iPhone 14 Pro), not the marketing generation number.

## Build from source

Requirements:

- macOS with Xcode
- `ldid` for packaging an unsigned IPA (`brew install ldid`)

Compile without installing on a device:

```sh
xcodebuild -project lara.xcodeproj \
  -scheme lara \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build
```

Package the release IPA:

```sh
./scripts/build_ipa.sh
```

The result is written to `build/Eagle.ipa`.
